// This file contains the extensions needed for the GameScene.swift file
// To use these methods, copy them into the GameScene.swift file within the GameScene class

// DO NOT use this file directly - it will cause errors because these functions 
// need access to the GameScene class properties and methods

// Copy and paste these implementations into the GameScene class
